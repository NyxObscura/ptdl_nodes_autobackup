# üìö Tutorial: Rclone Setup
Rclone is a powerful command-line program for synchronizing files and directories to and from various cloud storage providers.
# üñ•Ô∏è Rclone Setup on a VPS (Linux)
 * Install Rclone:
   Open your VPS terminal and run the following command to download and install Rclone:
   ```bash
   curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash
   ```
 * Configure Rclone:
   Once the installation is complete, start the interactive configuration process:
   rclone config

   * Choose n to create a new remote.
   * Provide a name for your remote (e.g., gdrive).
   * Select the cloud storage type you want to use (e.g., Google Drive).
   * For client_id and client_secret, you can leave them blank and press Enter to use Rclone's default values.
   * Choose the appropriate access scope (typically drive for full access).
   * Leave root_folder_id and service_account_file blank by pressing Enter.
   * Select N for "Edit advanced config?".
   * Select Y for "Use auto config?". Rclone will attempt to open a browser on your local machine for authentication. If you're running this on a headless VPS (without a GUI), see the note below.
   * After authorization in the browser, return to the terminal.
   * Configure as a Team Drive if necessary; otherwise, select N.
   * Review the summary and select y to save the configuration.
   * Select q to quit the configuration menu.
   Note for Headless VPS: If you cannot use "auto config," select N. Rclone will provide an rclone authorize command to run on a machine with a browser. Run that command, authorize, and copy the verification token back to your VPS terminal.
 * Verify Installation:
   You can list directories in your remote to ensure everything is working:
   ```bash
   rclone lsd your_remote_name:
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   rclone lsd gdrive:
   ```
# üíª Rclone Setup on Windows
 * Download Rclone:
   Visit the Rclone download page and download the zip file for Windows (Intel/AMD - 64 Bit).
 * Extract Files:
   Extract the rclone.exe file from the downloaded zip archive. You can place it in any directory. For ease of access, you might consider adding it to your system's PATH.
 * Open Command Prompt or PowerShell:
   Open your preferred terminal in Windows.
 * Run Configuration:
   Navigate to the directory where you extracted rclone.exe and run the configuration command:
   ```bash
   .\rclone.exe config
   ```
   The process is similar to that on a VPS:
   * n for a new remote.
   * Give it a name (e.g., onedrive).
   * Select your storage provider (e.g., Microsoft OneDrive).
   * Follow the prompts for authentication. "Auto config" will automatically open your default browser.
   * Log in to your account and grant the necessary permissions.
   * Return to the terminal, confirm settings, and quit.
 * Verify:
   Just like in Linux, test your connection:
   ```bash
   .\rclone.exe ls your_remote_name:
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   .\rclone.exe ls onedrive:
   ```
